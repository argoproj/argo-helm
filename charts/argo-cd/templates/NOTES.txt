In order to access the server UI you'll need to visit the following url:

1. {{ include "coreweave.externalDnsName" . }}

After reaching the UI the first time you can login with username: admin and the random password generated during the installation. You can find the password by running:

kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

(You should delete the initial secret afterwards as suggested by the Getting Started Guide: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#4-login-using-the-cli)
