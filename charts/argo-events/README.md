## Notes on CRD Installation

Some users would prefer to install the CRDs _outside_ of the chart. You can disable the CRD installation of this chart by using `--set installCRD=false` when installing the chart.

You can install the CRDs manually like so:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/raw/v0.14.0/hack/k8s/manifests/sensor-crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/raw/v0.14.0/hack/k8s/manifests/gateway-crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/raw/v0.14.0/hack/k8s/manifests/event-source-crd.yaml
```
